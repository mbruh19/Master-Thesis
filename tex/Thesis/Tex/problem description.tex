\section{Thesis Statement and Structure of Thesis}
The aim of this thesis is to answer the Thesis Statement: \textit{Is it possible to train binary and ternary neural networks using local search}? To answer this question, the following sub questions are considered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the best strategy for training discrete neural networks using local search?
    \item Is the local search training scalable with more data and larger networks? 
    \item How does training binary and ternary neural networks using local search compare to the existing literature? 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Before answering these questions, I first provide a literature review to summarize some of the most important studies related to training binary and ternary neural networks. Before introducing the local search model, I briefly present the most important machine learning theory. Having introduced the local search model I present how the local search works and how the discrete nature of the networks are utilized efficiently. I then outline the algorithms, that I have found to be the most promising. Finally, I present results for these algorithms, compare them and discuss limitations as well as future work.
