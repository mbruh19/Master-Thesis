\section{Thesis Statement and Structure of Thesis}
The aim of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of training binary and ternary neural networks using local search methods. This research addresses the following key questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the most effective strategies for training discrete neural networks using local search algorithms?
    \item How scalable are local search methods when applied to larger datasets and more complex network structures? 
    \item How do local search training methods for binary and ternary neural networks compare with the existing literature?
\end{itemize}

\noindent Before addressing the key questions, I first provide a literature review summarizing the most important studies related to training binary and ternary neural networks that are relevant in a local search context. Next, I present an overview of the most essential machine learning theory. Following this, I introduce the local search model, explain how the search works, and how the discrete nature of the networks is efficiently utilized. I then outline the most promising algorithms identified through this research. Finally, I present the results obtained from these algorithms, compare their performance, discuss the limitations encountered, and suggest directions for future work.
