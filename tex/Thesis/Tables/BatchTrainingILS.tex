\caption{Summary statistics for the Multiple Batches Iterated Local Search algorithm.
A BNN is trained with a single hidden layer with
64 neurons. The batch size is 1000, and the BestValAccuracy column tells on average how many validation
accuracies were calculated before the best one was found.}
